**                                                                                  **Adaptive Study Guide Generator**

AI-powered personalized learning platform that extracts educational content from YouTube videos, summarizes it intelligently, explains it in a simplified manner, and generates adaptive quizzes to enhance student learning.

**Project Overview**
The Adaptive Study Guide Generator is an AI-driven e-learning platform designed to help learners understand topics from YouTube videos more effectively.

Takes a YouTube video URL (supports multiple languages).

Extracts text using advanced speech-to-text techniques.

Summarizes content into concise, structured notes using NLP models.

Explains content in a learner-friendly way.

Generates quizzes with 5â€“10 MCQs and True/False questions.

If a learner scores below 50%, the system re-summarizes the topic in simpler terms and regenerates the quiz.

The process repeats until the learner achieves mastery.

This ensures a personalized, adaptive, and effective learning experience.

**Objectives**
1)Automate text extraction and summarization from video content.
2)Enable personalized learning by dynamically adjusting difficulty based on quiz performance.
3)Provide interactive quizzes for self-assessment.
4)Deliver hands-on experience in AI, NLP, frontend, backend, and API integrations.

**Installation & Setup**

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Adaptive-Study-Guide-Generator.git
cd Adaptive-Study-Guide-Generator

2. Set Up the Backend (Flask)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

3. Set Up the Frontend (React)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

4. Configure API Keys
Get a YouTube Transcript API key
Set up API keys in the .env file.

**API Integrations**

YouTube Transcript API â†’ Extracts spoken content from video.

Flask REST APIs â†’ Handles backend requests between frontend and AI modules.

NLP Libraries (Hugging Face, SpaCy, NLTK) â†’ Summarization, explanation, and quiz generation.

**Modules & Responsibilities**
Module	Owner	Responsibility
Video-to-Text Extraction	Person 1	Extracts transcript from YouTube video URLs
Text Summarization & Explanation	Person 2	Summarizes content & prepares simplified explanations
Quiz Generation	You	Generates 5â€“10 adaptive quiz questions (MCQs & True/False)
Adaptive Learning & Feedback	Person 4	Re-summarizes text & regenerates quizzes based on user performance

**Adaptive Learning Logic**

If score â‰¥ 50% â†’ Show results, mark topic as completed.

If score < 50% â†’

-> Simplify the summarized notes further.
-> Regenerate a new quiz with easier questions.
-> Allow the student to retry until mastery is achieved.
-> This ensures a personalized learning experience tailored to individual performance.
